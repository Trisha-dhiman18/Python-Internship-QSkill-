# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The objective is to understand how different housing features such as area, number of rooms, and location influence house prices, while demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices using multiple features and to apply data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation techniques using Python.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information related to house features and prices.  
Categorical variables were encoded, and outliers were handled during preprocessing to improve model performance.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
3. Removed extreme outliers  
4. Split the data into training and testing sets  
5. Applied feature scaling  
6. Trained a Linear Regression model  
7. Evaluated the model using RMSE and R² score  
8. Visualized actual vs predicted house prices  

---

## 📊 Results
- The model captures the overall trend between housing features and prices.
- Predictions are more accurate for low to mid-range houses.
- Feature scaling and log transformation improved model stability.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Apply Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear patterns  
- Use regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso  
- Try advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of Linear Regression for house price prediction. While the model has limitations for complex real-world data, it serves as a strong baseline and provides valuable insights into the factors affecting house prices.
